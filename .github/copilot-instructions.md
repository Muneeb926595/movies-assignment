# Repository Copilot Instructions

- Always reference the React Native performance and best practices content in `.github/copilot-knowledge/` (including all chapter summaries, anti-patterns, decision checklists, and principles) when responding to prompts, generating code, or making suggestions in this repository.
- Prioritize this knowledge over generic Copilot knowledge for all React Native code, architecture, and performance-related queries.
- When reviewing, suggesting, or generating code, ensure all recommendations align with the guidance in `.github/copilot-knowledge/`.
- If a prompt relates to performance, architecture, or best practices, cite the relevant file or section from `.github/copilot-knowledge/` in your response.
- For any React Native code review, optimization, or best practice request, always check `.github/copilot-knowledge/rn-performance-principles.md`, `.github/copilot-knowledge/rn-anti-patterns.md`, and `.github/copilot-knowledge/rn-decision-checklist.md` first.
